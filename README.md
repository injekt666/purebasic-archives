Introduction
============

-   <https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives>

This repo was created by Tristano Ajmone ([@tajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)) as a centralized place for gathering and sharing PureBASIC-realted resources: code examples and snippets, libraries, tutorials, books, and links — anything that can simplify a programmer’s life by either being herein archived or linked/reviewed.

Resources Organization
======================

The project is divided into folders according to categories:

-   [`/syntax-highlighting/`](./syntax-highlighting/) — publishing PureBASIC source code in colored syntax.
-   [`/text-editors/`](./text-editors/) — PureBASIC syntax support in text editors.
-   [`/repo-maintainance-tools/`](./repo-maintainance-tools/) — scripts related to the maintainance of this repository.

About PureBASIC
===============

PureBASIC is a commercial programming language and IDE published by Fantaisie Software (France):

> PureBasic is a native 32-bit and 64-bit programming language based on established BASIC rules. The key features of PureBasic are portability (Windows, Linux and MacOS X are currently supported), the production of very fast and highly optimized executables and, of course, the very simple BASIC syntax. PureBasic has been created for the beginner and expert alike. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast, reliable system friendly language.
>
> In spite of its beginner-friendly syntax, the possibilities are endless with PureBasic’s advanced features such as pointers, structures, procedures, dynamically linked lists and much more. Experienced coders will have no problem gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or API objects and PureBasic even allows inline ASM.
