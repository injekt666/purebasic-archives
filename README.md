Introduction
============

-   <https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives>

This repo was created by Tristano Ajmone ([@tajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)) as a centralized place for gathering and sharing PureBASIC-realted resources: code examples and snippets, libraries, tutorials, books, and links — anything that can simplify a programmer’s life by either being herein archived or linked/reviewed.

Resources Organization
======================

The Archives project is divided into folders according to categories:

-   [`/books/`](./books/) — books on PureBASIC programming.
-   [`/libs/`](./libs/) – 3rd party PureBASIC libraries, modules, wrappers, ecc.
-   [`/syntax-highlighting/`](./syntax-highlighting/) — publishing PureBASIC source code in colored syntax.
-   [`/text-editors/`](./text-editors/) — PureBASIC syntax support in text editors.

Some folders contain material specific to this repo’s developement and maintainance:

-   [`/repo-maintainance-tools/`](./repo-maintainance-tools/) — scripts related to the maintainance of this repository.

License
=======

This is a collection of various resources, and each resource comes with its own license. Please read carefully the licenses terms on a per-resource basis before incorporating them into your projects.

Nothing has been incorporated here that would prevent cloning this repository. As for the project in itself — ie: its structure, and my personal contributions in terms of documentations and project-related resources — its to be considered as released into the public domain according to the Unlicense terms (see: [Unlicense.org](http://unlicense.org/)).

About PureBASIC
===============

PureBASIC is a commercial programming language and IDE published by Fantaisie Software (France):

-   https://www.purebasic.com/

> PureBasic is a native 32-bit and 64-bit programming language based on established BASIC rules. The key features of PureBasic are portability (Windows, Linux and MacOS X are currently supported), the production of very fast and highly optimized executables and, of course, the very simple BASIC syntax. PureBasic has been created for the beginner and expert alike. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast, reliable system friendly language.
>
> In spite of its beginner-friendly syntax, the possibilities are endless with PureBasic’s advanced features such as pointers, structures, procedures, dynamically linked lists and much more. Experienced coders will have no problem gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or API objects and PureBasic even allows inline ASM.

More Collections on GitHub

PureBasic CodeArchiv (Rebirth)
------------------------------

-   https://github.com/GPIforGit/PureBasic-CodeArchiv-Rebirth

This project deserves a special mention. It seems to be a WIP to recreate an updated version of the historical **PureBasic CodeArchiv**, hosted at PureArea.net:

-   http://www.purearea.net/pb/CodeArchiv/CodeArchiv.html

**PureBasic CodeArchiv** contains a wealth of resources for PureBASIC version 3 and 4. Its license terms are:

> Design and compilation of the PureBasic CodeArchive is (c) 2003-2007 by Andre Beer and exclusive component of the www.PureArea.net PureBasic support site. You may use the codes published on this site without restrictions for your own projects, however a publication of this code archive on other web pages, CDRom etc., require the express consent of the author. The copyright of the individual codes lies at the respective authors.
