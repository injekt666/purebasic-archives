Introduction
============

Creation and maintainance of PureBASIC language syntax definitons will require having access to the full list of the language’s tokens. Unfortunately the task at hand is not that simple: PureBASIC doesn’t provide a list these tokens in a usable format. Furthermore, maintaining a tokens list of this kind will require to track changes with each new release of the language (new toknes, renaming, and deprecation).

Terminology
===========

To avoid confusion, we’ll refer here to all PureBASIC built-in reserved keyword as “*tokens*”. This allows us to better classify the actual tokens into groups since most code beatifiers and editors will require that tokens are grouped into meaningful categories. The actual group names and subdivisions may vary amongst different applications, so we should look at some usage examples and try to subdvide tokens in the higher number of groups, in order to cover the needs of all potential applications (merging multiple groups into a single one, for apps that require less categories, is an easy task).

Syntax Examples
---------------

So, let’s look at the tokens grouping conventions used by some syntax highlighters (beautifiers and editors alike), so that we can create a list of categories that would satisfy exporting tokens to any application.

### Kate Syntax Definitions

[Kate](https://kate-editor.org/)’s (KDE Advanced Text Editor) syntax definitions are also used by various syntax highlighters.

For example, **pandoc** ([&gt;=1.19.2](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.19.2)) uses [skylighting](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting) for syntax highlighting, which relies on Kate definitions, and ships with a [PureBASIC syntax definition](https://github.com/jgm/skylighting/blob/master/xml/purebasic.xml).

The Kate Syntax Definitions XML schema (`<!DOCTYPE language SYSTEM "language.dtd">`) can be found at:

-   <https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/blob/master/data/schema/language.xsd>

These are tokens groups used in the [PureBASIC syntax definition](https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/blob/master/data/syntax/purebasic.xml) (ASM not supported):

| TOKENS GROUP  | DESCRIPTION         | EXAMPLES                          |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **keywords**  | Basic Keywords      | `If`, `for`, `Procedure`, `Break` |
| **compiler**  | Compiler directives | `CompilerIf`, `CompilerSelect`    |
| **debug**     | Debugger directives | `Debug`, `CallDebugger`           |
| **functions** | Built-in commands   | `Abs`, `MessageRequester`         |

### GeSHi

[GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) (Generic Syntax Highlighter for PHP) 1.0 ships with a [PureBASIC syntax definition](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0/blob/master/src/geshi/purebasic.php).

Instead of named groups, GeSHi adopts numbered arrays to group tokens:

| TOKENS GROUP | DESCRIPTION             | EXAMPLES                                         |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **group 1**  | Keywords                | `If`, `for`, `Procedure`, `CompilerIf`, `Debug`, |
| **group 2**  | All Functions           | `Abs`, `MessageRequester`                        |
| **group 3**  | ASM instructions (some) | `AAA`, `JNZ`, `RET`                              |

Unlike Kate’s definition, GeSHi’s definition doesn’t subgroup compiler and debugger directives — in this case, the members of these groups could be just merged into group 1.

> **NOTE**: Keywords group 2 also contains functions from third party libraries, like `egrid_AddColumn` and all the other functions added by the **egrid** library by srod (see [PB Forum \#23769)](http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?t=23769).

Getting The Tokens List
=======================

The possible sources for these tokens are:

-   The documentation’s [Commands Index](http://www.purebasic.com/documentation/) page. (*WIP*)
-   The SDK’s syntax highlighter shared library. (*WIP*)
-   Invoking the compiler with special options. (*coming soon*)

Commands Index
--------------

The [Commands Index](http://www.purebasic.com/documentation/) page in the documentation — available both online (latest version only) as well as in PureBASIC installation — is an html document containing the list of all the command supported by any given version of PureBASIC, including commands that are OS specific.

Unfortunately, the online version of the documentation is available only for the latest release of PureBASIC, therefore other sources are needed to access previous versions of the file in order to build a version annoted list of these commands.

Older versions of this file can be taken from a PureBASIC installation ([or directly from the installer](#accessing-resources-within-the-installer)). On Windows, the html page will be inside the CHM Help file that is part of the installation, and will need to be extracted (CHM files can be unpacked like a ZIP file). On Mac, the documentation ships as loose html files, so no unpacking is required. On Linux the documentation is not in html.

### Documentation Parsers

User Marc56us has created a two useful code bases for extracting the list of commands and constants from the online [Commands Index](http://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/commandindex.html) and [PureBasic Constants](http://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/pbconstants.html) documentation pages:

-   [`Commands-Index-Parser.pb`](./Commands-Index-Parser.pb) — extract list of commands from online documentation.
-   [`PB-Keywords-Lister.pb`](./PB-Keywords-Lister.pb) — extract and save to file list of commands and constants from online documentation.

This code can easily be adapted to become part of a tokens extractor application.

The SDK’s Syntax Highlighter
----------------------------

PureBASIC for Windows comes with a syntax highlighter library in the SDK:

-   `\SDK\Syntax Highlighting\SyntaxHilighting.dll`

> (*sic*): the DLL file is actually (mis)named `SyntaxHilighting.dll`, not a typo on my side.

The DLL contains the keywords list of the language version it ships with. So (theoretically) it should be an up-to-date list reflecting the state of the syntax of any given version. I said “theoretically” because the SDK is in a pretty bad state, its documentation still refers to the Amiga in some places, and some sources therin are broken because they haven’t been updated for ages (see [PB Forum \#66969](http://www.purebasic.fr/english/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=66969)).

Since the DLL is in binary format, you’ll need and hex editor to peek inside it, and then work out a way of extracting the list. Also, the strings from version 5.50 onward are in Unicode format (UCS2 LE), before that they are in Ascii — any automated approach to extracting the strings must bare this in mind.

This is a screenshot of the contents of the `SyntaxHilighting.dll` that ships with PureBASIC 5.43, from [Hex Editor Neo](https://www.hhdsoftware.com/hex-editor):

![SyntaxHilighting.dll PB 5.43](./SyntaxHilighting.dll_PB543.png "Hex Editor Neo screenshot of 'SyntaxHilighting.dll' from PureBASIC 5.43")

And this is a screenshot of `SyntaxHilighting.dll` that ships with PureBASIC 5.50:

![SyntaxHilighting.dll PB 5.43](./SyntaxHilighting.dll_PB550.png "Hex Editor Neo screenshot of 'SyntaxHilighting.dll' from PureBASIC 5.50")

… you can clearly see the difference between the Ascii and Unicode strings.

### The Syntax Highlighting DLL Parser

-   [`Parse-Highlighting-DLL.pb`](./Parse-Highlighting-DLL.pb)

This app parses the `SyntaxHilighting.dll` and extract the list of keywords it contains, and saves them to a text file. The final list will contain three lists of keywords (in this order, and no separation between them):

1.  PureBASIC pseudotypes
2.  PureBASIC keywords
3.  ASM keywords

Any PureBASIC user should be able to easily distinguish when one list ends and the next one begins by his knowledge of the keywords and by the fact that the alphabetical ordering starts over again with each new list.

Please note that the final list will contain some duplicate keywords and a couple of non-strictly keywords strings (ie: `P` and `ABCUWLSFDQI`, the former relating to accessing procedures variables from inline Assembly, the latter being the list of characters used for native types).

The purpose of this tool is *not* to create a ready-to-use list of tokens: the purpose is to pass the lists to some diffing tool in order to see what has changed between different PureBASIC releases. This would allow a quick way to see if tokens have been added or removed since last version, allowing maintainers of language definitions to manually adjust their lists.

Bare in mind that the tokens list will not contain the built-in commands: PureBASIC IDE highlights user-created procedures and built-in functions in the same manner. For a full list of the built-in commands, refer to the [Commands Index](##commands-index) section of this document.

Accessing Resources Within The Installer
========================================

To avoid having to install each version of PureBASIC in order to access the above mentioned resources, the only workaround is to extract the contents of the binary installers, without actually installing anything.

The Linux installer is just a GZIP Compressed Tar Archive file (`*.tgz`), so you can unpack it with 7-Zip.

The Mac installer comes as an Apple Disk Image file (`*.dmg`), and it can be unpacked using 7-Zip too.

-   [www.7-Zip.org](http://www.7-zip.org/)

The Windows installer is a binary installer created with [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and it can’t be unpacked with ordinary compression tools like WinZip, 7-Zip and WinRAR.

You’ll need a free tool called **Universal Extractor**, an unpacker that supports a variaty of compression and isntaller formats, included the one used by the PureBASIC installer:
