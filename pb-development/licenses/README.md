Licenses for PureBASIC Applications
===================================

PureBASIC developers have to include a Licenses file with their released software because the PureBASIC compiler includes third party components in the final binaries.

PureBASIC documentation includes two ready-to-use license texts: a [common licenses text](https://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/license_application.html), for inclusion with all created applications; and additional [licenses text for apps that make use of the 3D engine](https://www.purebasic.com/documentation/reference/license_engine3d.html). So, the first one has to be *always* included with your apps, the second one only if your app uses the 3D engine.

PB 5.50 License Files
---------------------

Here you’ll find both licenses files in plaintext format, ready to be copied into your project folder:

-   [`PureBASIC_Applications_Licenses.txt`](PureBASIC_Applications_Licenses.txt)
-   [`PureBASIC_Applications_Licenses_3D-engine.txt`](PureBASIC_Applications_Licenses_3D-engine.txt)

> **NOTE 1**: These files contain the licenses as found on PureBASIC online documentation at the time of PuraBASIC version 5.50. The licenses therein contained are unliekly to change, but the introduction of new components in future versions of PureBASIC might introduce new licenses. If you are using a different version of PB, get the right licenses text from PureBASIC’s Help guide.

> **NOTE 2**: I’ve opted to use the `.txt` externsion and `CR+LF` linebreaks for the licenses files since it makes things easier on Windows users.
