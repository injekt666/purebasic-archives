  "body": "The PureBASIC Archives\r\n======================\r\n\r\nWelcome to «**The PureBASIC Archives**,» a collection of resources for the PureBASIC programming language.\r\n\r\nThe PB-Archives is a threefold project consisting of:\r\n\r\n1.  PureBASIC Archives repository\r\n2.  PureBASIC Archives Wiki\r\n3.  PureBASIC Archives website\r\n\r\nPureBASIC Archives Repository\r\n=============================\r\n\r\n-   <https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives>\r\n\r\nThe PureBASIC Archives repo was created by Tristano Ajmone ([@tajmone](https://github.com/tajmone)) as a centralized place for gathering and sharing PureBASIC-related resources: code examples and snippets, libraries, tutorials, books, and links — anything that can simplify a programmer’s life by either being herein archived or linked/reviewed.\r\n\r\nPureBASIC Archives Wiki\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n-   <https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives/wiki>\r\n\r\nThe [GitHub-hosted Wiki](https://github.com/tajmone/purebasic-archives/wiki) associated to the PureBASIC Archives project is intended as an online reference for PureBASIC – ie: not for tutorials, reviews of third party tools, ecc. Tips and tricks might be mentioned therein, as well as links to external resources that are pertinent to the subject matter of a Wiki entry, but any full-fledged article/tutorial should be placed instead inside the repo, and a short link to it placed in the Wiki.\r\n\r\nThe Wiki is pretty much still in the makings, it doesn’t contain much and hasn’t been structured in any significant way.\r\n\r\nPureBASIC Archives Website\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nWell, you’ve guessed it: you’re reading it at this very moment!\r\n\r\nRight now, it’s just a single-page website, created with [GitHub’s Automatic Page Generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator/) and freely hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). When the documents and tutorials of PB-Archives’ repo and wiki will reach a mature stage, I’m planning to make this website into a full-fledged and well organized portal – but this is a long-term project, unlikely to happen soon.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, this presentation page is all the website can offer.\r\n\r\nTristano Ajmone (Italy)\r\n",
